## Mandelbrot Set

Like many students of Computer Science, I wrote an app which renders
the Mandelbrot Set. Years later, despite cringing as I read the source code,
I'm still quite fond of this project. I'm publishing it as-is in the hope
that it may kindle my desire to publish other open source software.

I was most proud of this app's user interface. Users may draw a selection
using the mouse to zoom. Right-click to zoom out. The app displays a progress
bar and maintains a stack of zoom levels.
